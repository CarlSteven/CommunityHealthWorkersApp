Volunteer Management Application
==========

The code is based on Ionic.

Prerequisites:  
bower `npm install -g bower`
gulp `npm install -g gulp`

Inside project:   
`npm install`

Getting started:

1. Run `bower install`. Reads bower.json and installs local dependencies into the folder `www/bower_components`. ng-notify js has been modified and in `dist/ngnotify`

2. Run `ionic serve`. This uses `ionic.xml` and will serve as local node server. Live updates when you make changes to the code. This works with Phonegap Developer App.

3. `phonegap serve`
Works both in browser and with the Phone Gap developer app. Also updates when you make changes.
